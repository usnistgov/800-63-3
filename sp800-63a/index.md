# SP 800-63A

This is a working draft of NIST Special Publication 800-63A *Identity Proofing*. This document is a sub-document referenced by [SP 800-63-3](../sp800-63-3/README.html) covering the associated topics that had been previously in SP 800-63-2.

SP 800-63A deals with the processes by which an individual can prove their identity to a CSP prior to credential issuance.
