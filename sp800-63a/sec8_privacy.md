## <a name="privacy-section-header"></a> 8. Privacy Considerations

These privacy considerations provide information regarding the General Requirements set forth in Section 4.2.

### 8.1. Collection and Data Minimization 

Section 4.2(2) does not permit the CSP to collect the SSN unless it is necessary for performing identity resolution and cannot be accomplished by collection of another attribute or combination of attributes.  Unnecessary use of the SSN may be particularly vulnerable to misuse and can place the applicant at risk of harm such as through identity theft. The SSN may serve to achieve identity resolution for RPs, in particular federal agencies, that use SSNs to correlate a Subscriber to existing records.  Thus, this document recognizes the role of the SSN as an identifier and makes appropriate allowance for its use.  Note though that evidence requirements at the higher IALs preclude the usage of the SSN or the Social Security Card as acceptable identity evidence.  The initial requirement in Executive Order (EO) 9397 for all federal agencies to use the SSN as a primary means of identification for individuals working for, with, or conducting business with their agency, has since been eliminated. Accordingly, EO 9397 cannot be referenced as the sole authority establishing the collection of the SSN as necessary. Prior to collecting the SSN for identity proofing, organizations should consider any legal obligation to collect the SSN, the necessity of using the SSN for interoperability with third party processes and systems, or operational requirements. Operational requirements should be demonstrated by an inability to alter systems, processes, or forms due to cost or unacceptable levels of risk. Operational necessity should not be justified by ease of use or unwillingness to change. Federal agencies should review any decision to collect the SSN relative to their obligation to reduce the collection and unnecessary use of SSNs under Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-07-16, “Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable Information,” May 22, 2007, which requires agencies to review their use of social security numbers in agency systems and programs to identify instances in which collection or use of the social security number is superfluous.

Section 4.2 (3) permits only the collection of PII necessary to validate the existence of the claimed identity and associate the claimed identity to the applicant, based on best available practices for appropriate identity resolution, validation, and verification. Collection of unnecessary PII can create confusion as to why information is being collected if it is not being used for the identity proofing service and leads to concerns about invasiveness or overreach which can lead to loss of applicant trust. In addition, the retention of any PII can become vulnerable to unauthorized access or use. Data minimization reduces the amount of PII vulnerable to unauthorized access or use and encourages trust in the identity proofing process.  

### <a name="consent"></a>8.2. Notice and Consent

Section 4.2(4) requires the CSP to provide explicit notice at the time of collection to the applicant regarding the purpose for collecting and maintaining a record of the attributes necessary for identity proofing, including whether such attributes are voluntary or mandatory in order to complete the identity proofing transactions and the consequences for not providing the attributes.

An effective notice will take into account user experience design standards and research, as well as an assessment of privacy risks that may arise from the collection. There are various factors that should be considered, including the reliability of the assumptions Applicants may have about the collection, other information that may be collected from other sources and appended to the information collected from the Applicant, etc. However, an effective notice is never only a link that leads to a complex, legalistic privacy policy or general terms and conditions that Applicants are unlikely to read or understand. 

### 8.3. Use Limitation

Section 4.2(5) does not permit the CSP to use attributes collected and maintained in the identity proofing process for any purpose other than identity proofing, authentication, authorization or attribute assertions, or to comply with law or legal process unless the CSP provides clear notice and obtains consent from the subscriber for additional uses.

Care should be taken to ensure that use of attributes collected and maintained in the identity proofing process are limited to its’ original purpose for collection.  If use of such information does not fall within uses related to identity proofing, authentication, authorization or attribute assertions, or to comply with law or legal process, the CSP must provide notice and obtain consent from the subscriber. Consult your Senior Agency Official for Privacy if there are questions about whether proposed agency uses fall within the scope of these uses. This notice should follow the same principles as described in effective notice and should not be rolled up into a legalistic privacy policy or general terms and conditions.  Rather if there are uses outside the bounds of these explicit purposes, the subscriber should be provided with a meaningful way to understand the purpose for additional uses, and the opportunity to accept or decline.  The CSP cannot make acceptance by the subscriber of additional uses a condition of providing identity proofing services. 

### 8.4. Redress

Section 4.2(6) requires the CSP to provide effective mechanisms for redress of applicant complaints or problems arising from the identity proofing and make the mechanisms easy for applicants to find and access.

The Privacy Act requires federal CSPs maintaining a system of records to follow procedures to enable applicants to access and, if the records are incorrect, amend their records. Any Privacy Act Statement should include a reference to the applicable system of records notice(s) (SORN), which provides the applicant with instructions on how to make a request for access or correction. Non-federal CSPs should have comparable procedures, including contact information for any third parties if they are the source of the information.
CSPs should make clear to users the availability of alternative methods for completing the process, (e.g., in person at a customer service center, if available), in the event an applicant is unable to establish his/her identity and complete the registration process online. 

> Note:  If the ID proofing process is not successful, CSPs should inform the applicant of the procedures to address the issue but should not inform the applicant as to the specifics of why the registration failed, (e.g., do not inform the applicant, “Your SSN did not match the one that we have on record for you”) as doing so could allow fraudulent applicants to gain more knowledge about the accuracy of the PII.  



	
### 8.5. Privacy Risk Assessment

Sections 4.2(8) and (11) require the CSP to conduct a privacy risk assessment. In conducting a privacy risk assessment, CSPs should consider:  
 
1.  The likelihood that the action it takes (e.g. additional verification steps or records retention) could create a problem for the applicant such as invasiveness or unauthorized access to the information; and,
2. The impact if a problem did occur. CSPs should be able to justify any response it takes to identified privacy risks, including accepting the risk, mitigating the risk; and sharing the risk. The use of applicant consent should be considered a form of sharing the risk, and therefore should only be used when an applicant could reasonably be expected to have the capacity to assess and accept the shared risk.

### 8.6. Agency Specific Privacy Compliance 

Section 4.2(13) covers specific compliance obligations for federal CSPs. It is critical to involve your agency’s SAOP in the earliest stages of digital authentication system development to assess and mitigate privacy risks and as advise the agency on compliance requirements such as whether or not the collection of PII to conduct identity proofing triggers the Privacy Act of 1974 or the E-Government Act of 2002 requirement to conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment.  For example, with respect to identity proofing, it is likely that the Privacy Act requirements will be triggered and require coverage by either a new or existing Privacy Act system of records due to the collection and maintenance of attributes/PII necessary to conduct identity proofing. 

The SAOP can similarly assist the agency in determining whether a PIA is required.  These considerations should not be read as a requirement to develop a Privacy Act System of Records Notice or PIA for identity proofing alone; in many cases it will make the most sense to draft a PIA and SORN that encompasses the entire digital authentication process or include the digital authentication process as part of a larger programmatic PIA that discusses the program or benefit the agency is establishing online access to.  

Due to the many components of digital authentication, it is important for the SAOP to have an awareness and understanding of each individual component so as to advise appropriately on what compliance requirements apply. Moreover a thorough understanding of the individual components of digital authentication will enable the SAOP to thoroughly assess and mitigate privacy risks either through compliance processes or by other means.
