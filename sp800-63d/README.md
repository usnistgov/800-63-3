# SP 800-63A

This is a working draft of NIST Special Publication 800-63D *Identity Proofing*.

SP 800-63D focuses on asserting xAL, which are specific to the United States federal government, in a format that is machine readable and understandable to international partners. Central to this is the inclusion of three NIST approved open standards; namely IETF Vectors of Trust, OIDF iGov Profile, and Kantara **insert SAML name here**. The Kantara **name here** supercedes the FICAM SAML 2.0 Profile.
