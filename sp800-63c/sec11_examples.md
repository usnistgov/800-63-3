## 11. Assertion Examples

*This section is non-normative.*

Three types of assertion technologies will be discussed: SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) assertions, Kerberos tickets, and OpenID Connect tokens. 

### 11.1. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)

SAML is an XML-based framework for creating and exchanging authentication and attribute information between trusted entities over the internet. As of this writing, the latest specification for \[[SAML](#SAML)\] is SAML v2.0, issued 15 March 2005.

The building blocks of SAML include:

-   the Assertions XML schema which defines the structure of the assertion
-   the SAML Protocols which are used to request assertions and artifacts (the assertion references used in the indirect model described in Section 6.1) 
-   the Bindings that define the underlying communication protocols (such as HTTP or SOAP) and can be used to transport the SAML assertions. 

The three components above define a SAML profile that corresponds to a particular use case such as "Web Browser SSO".

SAML Assertions are encoded in an XML schema and can carry up to three types of statements:

-   *Authentication statements* include information about the
    assertion issuer, the authenticated subscriber, validity period, and
    other authentication information. For example, an Authentication
    Assertion would state the subscriber "John" was authenticated using a
    password at 10:32pm on 06-06-2004.

-   *Attribute statements* contain specific additional characteristics
    related to the subscriber. For example, subject "John" is associated
    with attribute "Role" with value "Manager".

-   *Authorization statements* identify the resources the subscriber
    has permission to access. These resources may include specific
    devices, files, and information on specific web servers. For
    example, subject "John" for action "Read" on "Webserver1002" given
    evidence "Role".

Authorization statements are beyond the scope of this document and will not be discussed.

### 11.2. Kerberos Tickets

The Kerberos Network Authentication Service \[[RFC 4120](#RFC4120)\] was
designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications using
symmetric-key cryptography on a local, shared network. Extensions to Kerberos
can support the use of public key cryptography for selected steps of the
protocol. Kerberos also supports confidentiality and integrity protection of
session data between the subscriber and the RP. Even though Kerberos uses
assertions, since it is designed for use on shared networks it is not truly a
federation protocol.

Kerberos supports authentication of a subscriber over an untrusted, shared
local network using one or more IdPs. The subscriber implicitly authenticates
to the IdP by demonstrating the ability to decrypt a random session key
encrypted for the subscriber by the IdP. (Some Kerberos variants also require
the subscriber to explicitly authenticate to the IdP, but this is not
universal.) In addition to the encrypted session key, the IdP also generates
another encrypted object called a Kerberos ticket. The ticket contains the
same session key, the identity of the subscriber to whom the session key was
issued, and an expiration time after which the session key is no longer
valid. The ticket is confidentiality and integrity protected by a
pre-established that is key shared between the IdP and the RP during an
explicit setup phase.

To authenticate using the session key, the subscriber sends the ticket to the
RP along with encrypted data that proves that the subscriber possesses the
session key embedded within the Kerberos ticket. Session keys are either used
to generate new tickets, or to encrypt and authenticate communications between
the subscriber and the RP.

To begin the process, the subscriber sends an authentication request to
the Authentication Server (AS). The AS encrypts a session key for the
subscriber using the subscriber's long term credential. The long term
credential may either be a secret key shared between the AS and the
subscriber, or in the PKINIT variant of Kerberos, a public key
certificate. It should be noted that most variants of Kerberos based on
a shared secret key between the subscriber and IdP derive this key
from a user generated password. As such, they are vulnerable to offline
dictionary attack by a passive eavesdropper. 

In addition to delivering the session key to the subscriber, the AS also
issues a ticket using a key it shares with the Ticket Granting Server
(TGS). This ticket is referred to as a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT),
since the verifier uses the session key in the TGT to issue tickets
rather than to explicitly authenticate the verifier. The TGS uses the
session key in the TGT to encrypt a new session key for the subscriber
and uses a key it shares with the RP to generate a ticket corresponding
to the new session key. The subscriber decrypts the session key and uses
the ticket and the new session key together to authenticate to the RP.

### 11.3. OpenID Connect

OpenID Connect is an internet-scale federated identity and authentication protocol built on top of the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework and the JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) cryptographic system. As of this writing, the latest specification is version 1.0 with errata, dated November 8, 2014. 

OpenID Connect builds on top of the OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol to enable the subscriber to authorize the RP to access the subscriber's identity and authentication information. The RP in both OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 is known as the client.

In a successful OpenID Connect transaction, the IdP issues an ID Token, which is a signed assertion in JSON Web Token (JWT) format. The client parses the ID Token to learn about the subscriber and primary authentication event at the IdP. This token contains at minimum the following claims about the subscriber and authentication event:

 - `iss`: An HTTPS URL identifying the IdP that issued the assertion
 - `sub`: An IdP-specific subject identifier representing the subscriber
 - `aud`: An IdP-specific audience identifier, equal to the OAuth 2.0 client identifier of the client at the IdP
 - `exp`: The timestamp at which the ID Token expires and after which SHALL NOT be accepted the client
 - `iat`: The timestamp at which the ID Token was issued and before which SHALL NOT be accepted by the client
 
In addition to the ID Token, the IdP also issues the client an OAuth 2.0 access token which can be used to access the UserInfo Endpoint at the IdP. This endpoint returns a JSON object representing a set of claims about the subscriber, including but not limited to their name, email address, physical address, phone number, and other profile information. While the information inside the ID Token is reflective of the authentication event, the information in the UserInfo Endpoint is generally more stable and could be more general purpose. Access to different claims from the UserInfo Endpoint is governed by the use of a specially defined set of OAuth scopes, `openid`, `profile`, `email`, `phone`, and `address`. An additional scope, `offline_access`, is used to govern the issuance of refresh tokens, which allow the RP to access the UserInfo Endpoint when the subscriber is not present.
