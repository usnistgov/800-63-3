## 3. Definitions and Abbreviations

There are a variety of definitions used in the area of authentication. While many terms are consistent with earlier revisions version of SP 800-63, some have changed in this revision. Since there is no single, consistent definition of many of these terms, careful attention to how the terms are defined here is warranted.

The definitions in this section are primarily those that are referenced in this document. Refer to the other documents in the SP 800-63 document family for additional definitions and abbreviations specific to their content.

A technological process that allows for the conveyance of identity and authentication information across a set of networked systems.
