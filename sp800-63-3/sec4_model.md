## 4. Digital Identity Model

*This section is informative.*

### <a name="4-1"></a>4.1. Overview 

The digital identity model used in these guidelines reflects current technologies and architectures available in the market. More complex models that separate functions - such as issuing credentials and providing attributes - among larger numbers of parties are also available and may have advantages in some classes of applications. While a simpler model is used in this document, it does not preclude agencies from separating these functions. In addition, certain enrollment, identity proofing, and issuance processes performed by the CSP are sometimes delegated to an entity known as either the RA or the identity manager (IM). A close relationship between the RA/IM and CSP is typical, and the nature of this relationship may differ among RAs, IMs, and CSPs. The types of relationship and their requirements is outside of the scope of this document. Accordingly, the term CSP will be used to be inclusive of RA and IM functions. Finally, a CSP may provide other services in addition to digital identity services. In these situations, the requirements specified throughout these documents only apply to the CSP function(s), not the additional services.

Digital identity is the unique representation of a subject engaged in an online transaction. The process used to verify a subject's association with their real world identity is called *identity proofing*. In this document suite, the party to be proofed is called an *applicant*. When the applicant successfully completes the proofing process, he or she is referred to as a *subscriber*. 

The strength of identity proofing is described by an ordinal measurement called the IAL. At IAL1, identity proofing is not required, therefore any attribute information provided by the applicant is self-asserted or should be treated as self-asserted and not verified. At IAL2 and IAL3, identity proofing is required, and the CSP may be requested by a RP to assert information about the subscriber, such as verified attribute values, verified attribute references, or pseudonymous identifiers. This information assists the RP in making authorization decisions. A RP may decide that it requires IAL2 or IAL3, but may only need specific attributes, perhaps those that retain a degree of pseudonymity for the subject. This privacy-enhancing approach is one of the benefits of separating the strength of the proofing process from that of the authentication process. A RP may also employ a federated identity approach where the RP outsources all identity proofing, attribute collection, and attribute storage to a CSP.

In this document suite, the party to be authenticated is called a *claimant* and the party verifying that identity is called a *verifier*. When a claimant successfully demonstrates possession and control of one or more authenticators to a verifier through an authentication protocol, the verifier can verify that the claimant is a valid subscriber. The verifier passes on an assertion about the subscriber, who may be either pseudonymous or non-pseudonymous, to the RP. That assertion includes an identifier, and may include identity information about the subscriber, such as the name, or other attributes that were collected in the enrollment process (subject to the policies of the CSP, the needs of the RP, and consent for disclosure of attributes given by the subject). Where the verifier is also the RP, the assertion may be implicit. The RP can use the authenticated information provided by the verifier to make authorization decisions.

Authentication establishes confidence that the claimant has possession of an authenticator(s) bound to the credential, and in some cases in the attribute values of the subscriber (for example if the subscriber is a U.S. citizen, is a student at a particular university, or is assigned a particular number or code by an agency or organization). Authentication does not determine the claimant's authorizations or access privileges; this is a separate decision, and is out of scope of this document suite. RPs can use a subscriber's authenticated identity and attributes with other factors to make authorization decisions. Nothing in this document suite precludes RPs from requesting additional information from a subscriber that has successfully authenticated.

The strength of the authentication process is described by an ordinal measurement called the AAL. AAL1 requires single-factor authentication and is permitted with a variety of different authenticator types. At AAL2, authentication requires two authentication factors for additional security. Authentication at the highest level, AAL3, requires the use of a hardware-based authenticator and one other factor.

The various entities and interactions that comprise the digital identity model used here are illustrated in [Figure 4-1](#63Sec4-Figure1).

**Figure 4-1. Digital Identity Model**
</div>

The left side of the diagram shows the enrollment, credential issuance, lifecycle management activities, and various states of an identity proofing and authentication process. The usual sequence of interactions is as follows:

1.	An applicant applies to a CSP through an enrollment process.
2.	The CSP identity proofs that applicant. Upon successful proofing, the applicant becomes a subscriber.
3.	Authenticator(s) and a corresponding credential are established between the CSP and the subscriber.
4.	The CSP maintains the credential, its status, and the enrollment data collected for the lifetime of the credential (at a minimum). The subscriber maintains his or her authenticator(s).

Other sequences are less common, but could also achieve the same functional requirements.

The right side of [Figure 4-1](#63Sec4-Figure1) shows the entities and interactions related to using an authenticator to perform digital authentication. A subscriber is referred to as a claimant when he or she needs to authenticate to a verifier. The interactions are as follows:

1.	The claimant proves possession and control of the authenticator(s) to the verifier through an authentication protocol.
2.	The verifier interacts with the CSP to validate the credential that binds the subscriber's identity to their authenticator and to optionally obtain claimant attributes.
3.	The CSP or verifier provides an assertion about the subscriber to the RP, which may use the information in the assertion to make an authorization decision.
4.	An authenticated session is established between the subscriber and the RP.

In all cases, the RP should request the attributes it requires from a CSP prior to authentication of the claimant.  In addition, the claimant should be requested to consent to the release of those attributes prior to generation and release of an assertion.

In some cases, the verifier does not need to communicate in real time with the CSP to complete the authentication activity (e.g., some uses of digital certificates). Therefore, the dashed line between the verifier and the CSP represents a logical link between the two entities rather than a physical link. In some implementations, the verifier, RP, and CSP functions may be distributed and separated as shown in [Figure 4-1](#63Sec4-Figure1); however, if these functions reside on the same platform, the interactions between the components are local messages between applications running on the same system rather than protocols over shared, untrusted networks.

As noted above, a CSP maintains status information about the credentials it issues. CSPs will generally assign a finite lifetime when issuing credentials to limit the maintenance period. When the status changes, or when the credentials near expiration, credentials may be renewed or re-issued; or, the credential may be revoked and destroyed. Typically, the subscriber authenticates to the CSP using his or her existing, unexpired authenticator and credential in order to request issuance of a new authenticator and credential. If the subscriber fails to request authenticator and credential re-issuance prior to their expiration or revocation, he or she may be required to repeat the enrollment process to obtain a new authenticator and credential. Alternatively, the CSP may choose to accept a request during a grace period after expiration.

### 4.2. Enrollment and Identity Proofing

Normative requirements can be found in [[SP 800-63A]](sp800-63a.html), *Enrollment and Identity Proofing*.

The previous section introduced the different participants in the conceptual digital identity model. This section provides additional details regarding the relationships and responsibilities of the participants involved with enrollment and identity proofing.

An individual, referred to as an *applicant* at this stage, opts to be identity proofed by a CSP. If the applicant is successfully proofed, the individual is then termed a subscriber of that CSP.

The CSP establishes a mechanism to uniquely identify each subscriber, register the subscriber's credentials, and track the authenticators issued to that subscriber. The subscriber may be given authenticators at the time of enrollment, the CSP may bind authenticators the subscriber already has, or they may be generated later as needed. Subscribers have a duty to maintain control of their authenticators and comply with their responsibilities to the CSP. The CSP maintains enrollment records for each subscriber to allow recovery of authenticators, for example, when they are lost or stolen.

### 4.3. Authentication and Lifecycle Management

Normative requirements can be found in [[SP 800-63B]](sp800-63b.html), *Authentication and Lifecycle Management*.

#### 4.3.1. Authenticators

The classic paradigm for authentication systems identifies three factors as the cornerstones of authentication:  

* Something you know (for example, a password).
* Something you have (for example, an ID badge or a cryptographic key).
* Something you are (for example, a fingerprint or other biometric data).

MFA refers to the use of more than one of the above factors. The strength of authentication systems is largely determined by the number of factors incorporated by the system - the more factors employed, the more robust the authentication system. For the purposes of these guidelines, using two factors is adequate to meet the highest security requirements. As discussed in [Section 5.1](#5-1), other types of information, such as location data or device identity, may be used by a RP or verifier to evaluate the risk in a claimed identity, but they are not considered authentication factors.

In digital authentication the claimant possesses and controls one or more authenticators that have been registered with the CSP and are used to prove the claimant's identity. The authenticator(s) contains secrets the claimant can use to prove that he or she is a valid subscriber, the claimant authenticates to a system or application over a network by proving that he or she has possession and control of one or more authenticators. 

The secrets contained in authenticators are based on either public key pairs (asymmetric keys) or shared secrets (symmetric keys). A public key and a related private key comprise a public key pair. The private key is stored on the authenticator and is used by the claimant to prove possession and control of the authenticator. A verifier, knowing the claimant's public key through some credential (typically a public key certificate), can use an authentication protocol to verify the claimant's identity by proving that the claimant has possession and control of the associated private key authenticator.

Shared secrets stored on authenticators may be either symmetric keys or memorized secrets (e.g., passwords and PINs), as opposed to the asymmetric keys described above, which subscribers need not share with the verifier. While both keys and passwords can be used in similar protocols, one important difference between the two is how they relate to the subscriber. While symmetric keys are generally stored in hardware or software that the subscriber controls, passwords are intended to be memorized by the subscriber. Since most users choose short passwords to facilitate memorization and ease of entry, passwords typically have fewer characters than cryptographic keys. Further, whereas systems choose keys at random, users attempting to choose memorable passwords will often select from a very small subset of the possible passwords of a given length, and many will choose very similar values. As such, whereas cryptographic keys are typically long enough to make network-based guessing attacks untenable, user-chosen passwords may be vulnerable, especially if no defenses are in place. 

In this document, authenticators always contain a secret. Some of the classic authentication factors do not apply directly to digital authentication. For example, a physical driver license is something you have, and may be useful when authenticating to a human (e.g., a security guard), but is not in itself an authenticator for digital authentication. Authentication factors classified as something you know are not necessarily secrets, either. Knowledge based authentication, where the claimant is prompted to answer questions that are presumably known only by the claimant, also does not constitute an acceptable secret for digital authentication. A biometric also does not constitute a secret. Accordingly, these guidelines only allow the use of biometrics for authentication when strongly bound to a physical authenticator.

A digital authentication system may incorporate multiple factors in one of two ways:

1. The system may be implemented so that multiple factors are presented to the verifier; or
2. Some factors may be used to protect a secret that will be presented to the verifier. 

For example, item 1 can be satisfied by pairing a memorized secret (what you know) with an out-of-band device (what you have). Both authenticator outputs are presented to the verifier to authenticate the claimant. For item 2, consider a piece of hardware (the authenticator) that contains a cryptographic key (the authenticator secret) where access is protected with a fingerprint. When used with the biometric, the cryptographic key produces an output that is used to authenticate the claimant.

As noted above, biometrics, when employed as a single factor of authentication, do not constitute acceptable secrets for digital authentication, but they do have their place in the authentication of digital identities. Biometric characteristics are unique personal attributes that can be used to verify the identity of a person who is physically present at the point of verification. They include facial features, fingerprints, iris patterns, voiceprints, and many other characteristics. [[SP 800-63A]](sp800-63a.html), *Enrollment and Identity Proofing* recommends that biometrics be collected in the enrollment process to later help prevent a registered subscriber from repudiating the enrollment and to help identify those who commit enrollment fraud.

#### 4.3.2. Credentials

As described in the preceding sections, a credential binds an authenticator to the subscriber, via an identifier, as part of the issuance process. A credential is stored and maintained by the CSP. The claimant possesses an authenticator, but is not necessarily in possession of the credential. For example, database entries containing the user attributes are considered to be credentials for the purpose of this document but are possessed by the verifier. X.509 public key certificates are a classic example of credentials the claimant can, and often does, possess.

#### 4.3.3. Authentication Process

The authentication process begins with the claimant demonstrating to the verifier possession and control of an authenticator that is bound to the asserted identity through an authentication protocol. Once possession and control have been demonstrated, the verifier verifies that the credential remains valid, usually by interacting with the CSP.

The exact nature of the interaction between the verifier and the claimant during the authentication protocol is extremely important in determining the overall security of the system. Well-designed protocols can protect the integrity and confidentiality of communication between the claimant and the verifier both during and after the authentication, and it can help limit the damage that can be done by an attacker masquerading as a legitimate verifier.

Additionally, mechanisms located at the verifier can mitigate online guessing attacks against lower entropy secrets like passwords and PINs by limiting the rate at which an attacker can make authentication attempts or otherwise delaying incorrect attempts. Generally, this is done by keeping track of and limiting the number of unsuccessful attempts, since the premise of an online guessing attack is that most attempts will fail.

The verifier is a functional role, but is frequently implemented in combination with the CSP, the RP, or both. If the verifier is a separate entity from the CSP, it is often desirable to ensure that the verifier does not learn the subscriber's authenticator secret in the process of authentication, or at least to ensure that the verifier does not have unrestricted access to secrets stored by the CSP.

### 4.4. Federation and Assertions

Normative requirements can be found in [[SP 800-63C]](sp800-63c.html), *Federation and Assertions*.

Overall, SP 800-63-3 does not presuppose a federated identity architecture; rather, these guidelines are agnostic to the types of models that exist in the marketplace, allowing agencies to deploy a digital authentication scheme according to their own requirements. However, identity federation is preferred over a number of siloed identity systems that each serve a single agency or RP.

Federated architectures have many significant benefits, including, but not limited to:  

* Enhanced user experience.  For example, an individual can be identity proofed once and can reuse the issued credential at multiple RPs.
* Cost reduction to both the user (reduction in authenticators) and the agency (reduction in IT infrastructure).
* Data minimization as agencies do not need to pay for collection, storage, disposal, and compliance activities related to storing personal information.
* Pseudonymous attribute assertions as agencies can request a minimized set of attributes, to include claims, to fulfill service delivery.
* Mission enablement as agencies can focus on mission, rather than the business of identity management.

The following sections discuss the components of a federated identity architecture should an agency elect this type of model.

#### 4.4.1. Assertions

Upon completion of the authentication process, the verifier generates an assertion containing the result of the authentication and provides it to the RP. The assertion is used to communicate the result of the authentication process, and optionally information about the subscriber, from the verifier to the RP. Assertions may be communicated directly to the RP, or can be forwarded through the subscriber, which has further implications for system design.

A RP trusts an assertion based on the source, the time of creation, how long the assertion is valid from time of creation, and the corresponding trust framework that governs the policies and process of CSPs and RPs. The verifier is responsible for providing a mechanism by which the integrity of the assertion can be confirmed. 

The RP is responsible for authenticating the source (the verifier) and for confirming the integrity of the assertion. When the verifier passes the assertion through the subscriber, the verifier must protect the integrity of the assertion in such a way that it cannot be modified. However, if the verifier and the RP communicate directly, a protected session may be used to preserve the integrity of the assertion. When sending assertions across an open network, the verifier is responsible for ensuring that any sensitive subscriber information contained in the assertion can only be extracted by a RP that it trusts to maintain the information's confidentiality.

Examples of assertions include:

* Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) assertions are specified using a mark-up language intended for describing security assertions. They can be used by a verifier to make a statement to a RP about the identity of a claimant. SAML assertions may optionally be digitally signed.
* OpenID Connect claims are specified using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) for describing security, and optionally, user claims.  JSON user info claims may optionally be digitally signed.
* Kerberos tickets allow a ticket granting authority to issue session keys to two authenticated parties using symmetric key based encapsulation schemes.

#### 4.4.2. Relying Parties

A RP relies on results of an authentication protocol to establish confidence in the identity or attributes of a subscriber for the purpose of conducting an online transaction. RPs may use a subscriber's authenticated identity (pseudonymous or non-pseudonymous), the IAL, AAL, and FAL (FAL indicating the strength of the assertion protocol), and other factors to make authorization decisions. The verifier and the RP may be the same entity, or they may be separate entities. If they are separate entities, the RP normally receives an assertion from the verifier. The RP ensures that the assertion came from a verifier trusted by the RP. The RP also processes any additional information in the assertion, such as personal attributes or expiration times. The RP is the final arbiter concerning whether a specific assertion presented by a verifier meets the RP's established criteria for system access regardless of IAL, AAL, or FAL.
