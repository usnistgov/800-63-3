# Special Publication 800-63 *Digital Identity Guidelines*

# *The finalized four-volume SP 800-63 *Digital Identity Guidelines* is now available, both in PDF format and online.

# *The official versions of these documents are the PDFs available at:
*  <https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63-3>
*  <https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63a>
*  <https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63b>
*  <https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63c>

# *This repository, used for development of the SP 800-63 document suite, is available as a resource for those who prefer to view the documents in HTML form or who wish to view the original Markdown.

# *Because of differences in Markdown rendering engines, the best place to view the HTML is on the NIST Pages website at <https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/> rather than the GitHub rendering of the documents.

# *While this is believed to be a faithful representation of the official PDF documents, NIST would appreciate being informed about any inconsistencies that may be found other than minor formatting differences. These may be reported to <dig-comments@nist.gov>.
