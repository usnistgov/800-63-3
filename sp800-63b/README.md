# *SP 800-63B

# *This is NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-63B *Authentication and Lifecycle Management*. This document is referenced by SP 800-63-3 covering the associated topics that had been previously in SP 800-63-2.

# *The official version of this document is the PDF available at <https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63b>. This repository, used for development of the SP 800-63 document suite, is available as a resource for those who prefer to view the documents in HTML form or who wish to view the original Markdown.

# *Because of differences in Markdown rendering engines, the best place to view the HTML is on the NIST Pages website at <https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/> rather than the GitHub rendering of the documents.

# *While this is believed to be a faithful representation of the official PDF documents, NIST would appreciate being informed about any inconsistencies that may be found other than minor formatting differences. These may be reported to <dig-comments@nist.gov>.
