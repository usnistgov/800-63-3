## <a name="AAL_SEC4"></a>4. Authenticator Assurance Levels

In order to satisfy the requirements of a given Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL), a claimant SHALL authenticate themselves with at least a given level of strength to be recognized as a subscriber. The result of an authentication process is an identifier, that MAY be pseudonymous, that SHALL be used each time that subscriber authenticates to that relying party. Optionally, other attributes that identify the subscriber as a unique person may also be provided.

Detailed normative requirements for authenticators and verifiers at each AAL are provided in Section 5.

FIPS 140 requirements are satisfied by [[FIPS 140-2]](#FIPS140-2) or newer revisions.

### 4.1. Authenticator Assurance Level 1

AAL 1 provides single factor remote network authentication, giving some assurance that the same Claimant who participated in previous transactions is accessing the protected transaction or data. AAL 1 allows a wide range of available authentication technologies to be employed and requires only a single authentication factor to be used. It also permits the use of any of the authentication methods of higher authenticator assurance levels. Successful authentication requires that the Claimant prove through a secure authentication protocol that he or she possesses and controls the authenticator.

#### 4.1.1. Permitted Authenticator Types

Authenticator Assurance Level 1 permits the use of any of the following authenticator types, defined in Section 5:

* Memorized Secret
* Look-up Secret
* Out of Band (Partially deprecated; see [Section 5.1.3](#out-of-band) for more details)
* Single Factor OTP Device
* Multi-Factor OTP Device
* Single Factor Cryptographic Device
* Multi-Factor Software Cryptographic Authenticator
* Multi-Factor Cryptographic Device

#### 4.1.2. Authenticator and Verifier Requirements

Cryptographic authenticators used at AAL 1 SHALL use approved cryptography.

Verifiers operated by government agencies at AAL 1 SHALL be validated to meet the requirements of [[FIPS 140]](#FIPS140-2) Level 1.

#### 4.1.3. Assertion Requirements

In order to be valid at AAL 1, authentication assertions SHALL meet the requirements defined in [SP 800-63C](sp800-63c.html). Bearer assertions MAY be used.

#### <a name="aal1reauth"></a>4.1.4. Reauthentication

At AAL 1, reauthentication of the subscriber SHOULD be repeated at least once per 30 days, regardless of user activity.

#### 4.1.5. Security Controls

The CSP SHALL employ appropriately tailored security controls from the low baseline of security controls defined in [[SP 800-53]](#SP800-53) or equivalent industry standard and SHALL ensure that the minimum assurance requirements associated with the *low* baseline are satisfied.

#### 4.1.6. Records Retention

The CSP shall comply with their respective records retention policies in accordance with whatever laws and/or regulations apply. Otherwise, no retention period is required.

### 4.2. Authenticator Assurance Level 2

AAL 2 provides higher assurance that the same claimant who participated in previous transactions is accessing the protected transaction or data. At least two different authentication factors are required. Various types of authenticators, including multi-factor software cryptographic authenticators, may be used as described below. AAL 2 also permits any of the authentication methods of AAL 3. AAL 2 authentication requires cryptographic mechanisms that protect the primary authenticator against compromise by the protocol threats for all threats at AAL 1 as well as against verifier impersonation attacks. Approved cryptographic techniques are required at AAL 2 and above.

#### 4.2.1. Permitted Authenticator Types

At AAL 2, it is required to have (a) a multi-factor authenticator, or (b) a combination of two single-factor authenticators. Authenticator requirements are specified in Section 5.

When a multi-factor authenticator is used, any of the following may be used:

* Multi-Factor OTP Device
* Multi-Factor Software Cryptographic Authenticator
* Multi-Factor Cryptographic Device

When a combination of two single-factor authenticators is used, it SHALL include a Memorized Secret authenticator and one possession-based ("something you have") authenticator from the following list:

* Look-up Secret
* Out of Band
* Single Factor OTP Device
* Single Factor Cryptographic Device

> Note: The requirement for a memorized secret authenticator above derives from the need for two different types of authentication factors to be used. All biometric authenticators compliant with this specification are multi-factor, so something you know (a memorized secret) is the remaining possibility.

#### 4.2.2. Authenticator and Verifier Requirements

Cryptographic authenticators used at AAL 2 SHALL use approved cryptography. Authenticators developed by government agencies SHALL be validated to meet the requirements of [[FIPS 140]](#FIPS140-2) Level 1.

Verifiers operated by government agencies at AAL 2 SHALL be validated to meet the requirements of [[FIPS 140]](#FIPS140-2) Level 1.

#### 4.2.3. Assertion Requirements

In order to be valid at AAL 2, authentication assertions SHALL meet the requirements defined in [SP 800-63C](sp800-63c.html). Bearer assertions MAY be used.

#### <a name="aal2reauth"></a>4.2.4. Reauthentication

At AAL 2, authentication of the subscriber SHALL be repeated at least once per 12 hours, regardless of user activity. Reauthentication of the subscriber SHALL be repeated following no more than 30 minutes of user inactivity. The CSP MAY prompt the user to cause activity just before the inactivity timeout, if desired. Reauthentication MAY use one of two authentication factors if the AAL 2 requirements of [Section 5.2.4](#reauth_sm) are met.

#### 4.2.5. Security Controls

The CSP SHALL employ appropriately tailored security controls from the moderate baseline of security controls defined in [[SP 800-53]](#SP800-53) or equivalent industry standard and SHALL ensure that the minimum assurance requirements associated with the *moderate* baseline are satisfied.

#### 4.2.6. Records Retention

CSPs shall comply with their respective records retention policies in accordance with whatever laws and/or regulations apply to those entities. Otherwise, retention of records is required for seven years and 6 months.

### 4.3. Authenticator Assurance Level 3

AAL 3 is intended to provide the highest practical remote network authentication assurance. Authentication at AAL 3 is based on proof of possession of a key through a cryptographic protocol. AAL 3 is similar to AAL 2 except that only “hard” cryptographic authenticators are allowed.

#### 4.3.1. Permitted Authenticator Types

Authentication Assurance Level 3 requires the use of one of two kinds of hardware devices:

* Multi-factor OTP Device
* Multi-Factor Cryptographic Device

#### 4.3.2. Authenticator and Verifier Requirements

Authenticators used at AAL 3 SHALL be hardware cryptographic modules validated at [[FIPS 140]](#FIPS140-2) Level 2 or higher overall with at least [[FIPS 140]](#FIPS140-2) Level 3 physical security. AAL 3 authenticator requirements CAN be met by using the PIV authentication key of a [[FIPS 201]](#FIPS201) compliant Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Card.

Verifiers at AAL 3 SHALL be validated at [[FIPS 140]](#FIPS140-2) Level 2 or higher.

#### 4.3.3. Assertion Requirements

In order to be valid at AAL 3, authentication assertions SHALL meet the requirements of proof-of-possession assertions as defined in [SP 800-63C](sp800-63c.html).

#### <a name="aal3reauth"></a>4.3.4. Reauthentication

At AAL 3, authentication of the subscriber SHALL be repeated at least once per 12 hours, regardless of user activity. Reauthentication of the subscriber SHALL be repeated following a period of no more than 15 minutes of user inactivity. It is permissible to prompt the user to cause activity just before the inactivity timeout, if desired.

#### 4.3.5. Security Controls

The CSP SHALL employ appropriately tailored security controls from the high baseline of security controls defined in [[SP 800-53]](#SP800-53) or equivalent industry standard and SHALL ensure that the minimum assurance requirements associated with the *high* baseline are satisfied.

#### 4.3.6. Records Retention

CSP shall comply with their respective records retention policies in accordance with whatever laws and/or regulations apply to those entities. Otherwise, retention of records is required for ten years and 6 months.
