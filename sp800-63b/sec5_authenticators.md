## 5. <a name="AAL_SEC5"></a>Authenticator and Verifier Requirements

_This section is normative._

This section provides the detailed requirements specific for each type of authenticator. With the exception of reauthentication requirements specified in [Section 4](#AAL_SEC4) and the requirement for verifier impersonation resistance at AAL3 described in [Section 5.2.5](#verifimpers), the technical requirements for each of the authenticator types are the same regardless of the AAL at which the authenticator is used.

### <a name="reqauthtype"></a> 5.1. Requirements by Authenticator Type

#### 5.1.1. Memorized Secrets

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="sp800-63b/media/Memorized-secret.png" alt="authenticator" style="width: 100px;height: 100px;min-width:100px;min-height:100px;"/></td>
    <td>A Memorized Secret authenticator (commonly referred to as a <i>password</i> or, if numeric, a <i>PIN</i>) is a secret value that is intended to be chosen and memorable by the user. Memorized secrets need to be of sufficient complexity and secrecy that it would be impractical for an attacker to guess or otherwise discover the correct secret value.</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  </div>

#### 5.1.1.1. Memorized Secret Authenticators

Memorized secrets SHALL be at least 8 characters in length if chosen by the subscriber; memorized secrets chosen randomly by the CSP or verifier SHALL be at least 6 characters in length and MAY be entirely numeric.  Since the CSP or verifier may disallow some choices of memorized secrets based on their appearance on a blacklist of compromised values, the subscriber SHALL choose a different memorized secret if a choice is rejected. No other complexity requirements for memorized secrets SHOULD be imposed; a rationale for this is presented in [Appendix A](#appA).

#### 5.1.1.2. Memorized Secret Verifiers

Verifiers SHALL require subscriber-chosen memorized secrets to be at least 8 characters in length. Verifiers SHOULD permit user-chosen memorized secrets to be up to 64 characters or more in length. All printing ASCII [[RFC 20]](#RFC20) characters as well as the space character SHOULD be acceptable in memorized secrets; Unicode [[ISO/ISC 10646:2014]](#ISOIEC10646) characters SHOULD be accepted as well. Verifiers MAY remove multiple consecutive space characters, or all space characters, prior to verification provided that the result is at least 8 characters in length. Truncation of the secret SHALL NOT be performed. For purposes of the above length requirements, each Unicode code point SHALL be counted as a single character.

If Unicode characters are accepted in memorized secrets, the verifier SHOULD apply the Normalization Process for Stabilized Strings defined in Section 12.1 of Unicode Standard Annex 15 [[UAX 15]](#UAX15) using either the NFKC or NFKD normalization. Subscribers choosing memorized secrets containing Unicode characters SHOULD be advised that some characters may be represented differently by some endpoints, which can affect their ability to authenticate successfully. This process is applied prior to hashing of the byte string representing the memorized secret.

Memorized secrets that are randomly chosen by the CSP (e.g., at enrollment) or by the verifier (e.g., when a user requests a new PIN) SHALL be at least 6 characters in length and SHALL be generated using an approved random bit generator.

Memorized secret verifiers SHALL NOT permit the subscriber to store a "hint" that is accessible to an unauthenticated claimant. Verifiers also SHALL NOT prompt subscribers to use specific types of information (e.g., "What was the name of your first pet?") when choosing memorized secrets.

When processing requests to establish and change memorized secrets, verifiers SHALL compare the prospective secrets against a list that contains values known to be commonly-used, expected, or compromised. For example, the list MAY include (but is not limited to):

* Passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses.
* Dictionary words.
* Repetitive or sequential characters (e.g. 'aaaaaa', '1234abcd').
* Context specific words, such as the name of the service, the username, and derivatives thereof.

If the chosen secret is found in the list, the CSP or verifier SHALL advise the subscriber that they need to select a different secret, SHALL provide the reason for rejection, and SHALL require the subscriber to choose a different value.

Verifiers SHALL implement a throttling mechanism that effectively limits the number of failed authentication attempts an attacker can make on the subscriber's account as described in [Section 5.2.2](#throttle).

Verifiers SHOULD NOT impose other composition rules (e.g., mixtures of different character types) on memorized secrets. Verifiers SHOULD NOT require memorized secrets to be changed arbitrarily (e.g., periodically) and SHOULD only require a change if the subscriber requests a change or there is evidence of compromise of the authenticator.

In order to assist the claimant in entering a memorized secret successfully, the verifier SHOULD offer an option to display the secret (rather than a series of dots or asterisks, typically) until it is entered. This allows the claimant to verify their entry if they are in a location where their screen is unlikely to be observed. The verifier MAY also permit the user's device to display individual entered characters for a short time after each character is typed to verify correct entry, particularly on mobile devices. 

The verifier SHALL use approved encryption and SHALL utilize an authenticated protected channel when requesting memorized secrets in order to provide resistance to eavesdropping and MitM attacks.

Verifiers SHALL store memorized secrets in a form that is resistant to offline attacks. Secrets SHALL be hashed with a *salt* value using an approved hash function such as PBKDF2 as described in [[SP 800-132]](#SP800-132). The salt value SHALL be a 32-bit or longer random value generated by an approved random bit generator and stored along with the hash result. At least 10,000 iterations of the hash function SHOULD be performed. A keyed hash function (e.g., HMAC [[FIPS198-1]](#FIPS198-1)), with the key stored separately from the hashed authenticators (e.g., in a hardware security module) SHOULD be used to further resist dictionary attacks against the stored hashed authenticators.

#### <a name="lookupsecrets"></a> 5.1.2. Look-up Secrets

<div class="text-left" markdown="1">
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="sp800-63b/media/Look-up-secrets.png" alt="authenticator" style="width: 100px;height: 100px;min-width:100px;min-height:100px;"/></td>
    <td>A look-up secret authenticator is a physical or electronic record that stores a set of secrets shared between the claimant and the CSP. The claimant uses the authenticator to look up the appropriate secret(s) needed to respond to a prompt from the verifier. For example, a claimant may be asked by the verifier to provide a specific subset of the numeric or character strings printed on a card in table format. A common application of look-up secrets is the use of "recovery keys" stored by the subscriber for use in the event another authenticator is lost or malfunctions.</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  </div>

#### 5.1.2.1. Look-up Secret Authenticators
CSPs creating look-up secret authenticators SHALL use an approved random bit generator to generate the list of secrets, and SHALL deliver the authenticator securely to the subscriber. Look-up secrets SHALL have at least 64 bits of entropy, or SHALL have at least 20 bits of entropy if the number of failed authentication attempts is limited as described in [Section 5.2.2](#throttle).

If the authenticator uses look-up secrets sequentially from a list, the subscriber MAY dispose of used secrets, but only after a successful authentication.

#### 5.1.2.2. Look-up Secret Verifiers

Verifiers of look-up secrets SHALL prompt the claimant for the next secret from their authenticator or for a specific (e.g., numbered) secret. A given secret from an authenticator SHALL be used successfully only once; therefore, a given authenticator can only be used for a finite number of successful authentications. If the look-up secret is derived from a grid card, each cell of the grid SHALL be used only once.

Verifiers SHALL store look-up secrets in a form that is resistant to offline attacks. Secrets SHALL be hashed with a *salt* value using an approved hash function as described in [[SP 800-132]](#SP800-132). The salt value SHALL be a 128-bit or longer random value generated by an approved random bit generator that is stored along with the hash result. A keyed hash function (e.g., HMAC [[FIPS198-1]](#FIPS198-1)), with the key stored separately from the hashed authenticators (e.g., in a hardware security module) SHOULD be used to further resist dictionary attacks against the stored hashed authenticators.

Look-up secrets SHALL be generated using an approved random bit generator and SHALL have at least 20 bits of entropy. When look-up secrets have less than 64 bits of entropy, the verifier SHALL implement a throttling mechanism that effectively limits the number of failed authentication attempts an attacker can make on the subscriber's account as described in [Section 5.2.2](#throttle).

The verifier SHALL use approved encryption and SHALL utilize an authenticated protected channel when requesting look-up secrets in order to provide resistance to eavesdropping and MitM attacks.

    <td><img src="sp800-63b/media/Out-of-band-OOB.png" alt="authenticator" style="width: 100px;height: 100px;min-width:100px;min-height:100px;"/></td>
    <td>An out-of-band authenticator is a physical device that is uniquely addressable and can communicate securely with the verifier over a distinct communications channel, referred to as the secondary channel. The device is possessed and controlled by the claimant and supports private communication over this secondary channel that is separate from the primary channel for e-authentication. The out-of-band authenticator can operate in one of the following ways: <br><br>

- The claimant transfers a secret received by the out-of-band device via the secondary channel to the verifier using the primary channel. For example, the claimant may receive the secret on their mobile device and type it (typically a 6-digit code) into their authentication session.<br><br>

- The claimant transfers a secret received via the primary channel to the out-of-band device for transmission to the verifier via the secondary channel. For example, the claimant may view the secret on their authentication session and either type it into an app on their mobile device or use a technology such as a barcode or QR code to effect the transfer.<br><br>

- The claimant compares secrets received from the primary channel and the secondary channel and confirms the authentication via the secondary channel.<br><br>

The purpose of the secret is to securely bind the authentication operation on the primary and secondary channel. When the response is via the primary communication channel, the secret also establishes the claimant's control of the out-of-band device.</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  </div>

#### 5.1.3.1. Out-of-Band Authenticators

The out-of-band authenticator SHALL establish a separate channel with the verifier in order to retrieve the out-of-band secret or authentication request. This channel is considered to be out-of-band with respect to the primary communication channel, even if it terminates on the same device, provided the device does not leak information from one to the other without the authorization of the claimant.

The out-of-band device SHOULD be uniquely addressable and communication over the secondary channel SHALL be private. Methods that do not prove possession of a specific device, such as voice-over-IP (VOIP) or email, SHALL NOT be used for out-of-band authentication.

The out-of-band authenticator SHALL uniquely authenticate itself in one of the following ways in communicating with the verifier:

- Establish an authenticated protected channel to the verifier using approved cryptography. The key used SHALL be stored in the most secure storage available on the device (e.g., keychain storage, trusted platform module, trusted execution environment).

- Authenticate to a public mobile telephone network using a SIM card or equivalent that uniquely identifies the device. This method SHALL only be used if a secret is being sent from the verifier to the out-of-band device via the telephone network (SMS or voice).

If a secret is sent by the verifier to the out-of-band device, the device SHOULD NOT display the authentication secret on a device while it is locked by the owner (i.e., requires an entry of a PIN, passcode, or biometric). However, authenticators SHOULD indicate the receipt of an authentication secret on a locked device.

If the out-of-band authenticator sends an approval message over the secondary communication channel (rather than by the claimant transferring a received secret to the primary communication channel), it SHALL do one of the following:

* The authenticator SHALL accept transfer of the secret from the primary channel which it SHALL send to the verifier over the secondary channel to associate the approval with the authentication transaction. The claimant MAY perform the transfer manually or use a technology such as a barcode or QR code to effect the transfer.

* The authenticator SHALL present a secret received via the secondary channel from the verifier and prompt the claimant to verify the consistency of that secret with the primary channel, prior to accepting a yes/no response from the claimant. It SHALL then send that response to the verifier.

#### 5.1.3.2. Out-of-Band Verifiers

If out-of-band verification is to be made using the public switched telephone network (PSTN), the verifier SHALL verify that the pre-registered telephone number being used is associated with a physical device. Changing the pre-registered telephone number SHALL NOT be possible without two-factor authentication at the time of the change. Verifiers SHALL use known and verifiable routes to deliver the secret, for example, by using Class 2 SMS. Verifiers SHOULD be aware of indicators such as device swap, SIM change, number porting, or other abnormal behavior *before* using the PSTN to deliver an out-of-band authentication secret.

> Note: Out-of-band authentication using the PSTN (SMS or voice) is discouraged and is being considered for removal in future editions of this guideline.

If out-of-band verification is to be made using a secure application, such as on a smart phone, the verifier MAY send a push notification to that device. The verifier then waits for the establishment of an authenticated protected channel and verifies the authenticator's identifying key. The verifier SHALL NOT store the identifying key itself, but SHALL use a verification method such as use of an approved hash function or proof of possession of the identifying key to uniquely identify the authenticator. Once authenticated, the verifier transmits the authentication secret to the authenticator.

Depending on the type of out-of-band authenticator, one of the following SHALL take place:

* Transfer of secret to primary channel - The verifier MAY signal the device containing the subscriber's authenticator to indicate readiness to authenticate. It SHALL then transmit a random secret to the out-of-band authenticator. The verifier SHALL then wait for the secret to be returned on the primary communication channel.

* Transfer of secret to secondary channel - The verifier SHALL display a random authentication secret to the claimant via the primary channel. It SHALL then wait for the secret to be returned on the secondary channel from the claimant's out-of-band authenticator.

* Verification of secrets by claimant - The verifier SHALL display a random authentication secret to the claimant via the primary channel, and SHALL send the same secret to the out-of-band authenticator via the secondary channel for presentation to the claimant. It SHALL then wait for an approval (or disapproval) message via the secondary channel.

In all cases, the authentication SHALL be considered invalid if not completed within 5 minutes. In order to provide replay resistance as described in Section [5.2.7](#replay), verifiers SHALL accept a given authentication secret only once during the validity period.

The verifier SHALL generate random authentication secrets with at least 20 bits of entropy using an approved random bit generator. If the authentication secret has less than 64 bits of entropy, the verifier SHALL implement a throttling mechanism that effectively limits the number of failed authentication attempts an attacker can make on the subscriber's account as described in [Section 5.2.2](#throttle).

#### <a name="singlefactorOTP"></a> 5.1.4. Single-factor OTP Device

<div class="text-left" markdown="1">

    <td>A single-factor OTP device generates OTPs. This includes hardware devices as well as software-based OTP generators installed on devices such as mobile phones. This device has an embedded secret that is used as the seed for generation of OTPs and does not require activation through a second factor. The OTP is displayed on the device and manually input to the verifier, thereby proving possession and control of the device. An OTP device may, for example, display 6 characters at a time. A single-factor OTP device is <i>something you have</i>.<br><br>

Single-factor OTP devices are similar to look-up secret authenticators with the exception that the secrets are cryptographically and independently generated by the authenticator and verifier and compared by the verifier. The secret is computed based on a nonce that may be time-based or from a counter on the authenticator and verifier.</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  </div>

#### <a name="sfotpa"></a>5.1.4.1. Single-factor OTP Authenticators

Single-factor OTP authenticators contain two persistent values. The first is a symmetric key that persists for the lifetime of the device. The second is a nonce that is changed each time the authenticator is used or is based on a real-time clock.

The secret key and its algorithm SHALL provide at least the minimum security strength specified in the latest revision of [[SP 800-131A]](#SP800-131A) (112 bits as of the date of this publication). The nonce SHALL be of sufficient length to ensure that it is unique for each operation of the device over its lifetime.

The authenticator output is obtained by using an approved block cipher or hash function to combine the key and nonce in a secure manner. The authenticator output MAY be truncated to as few as 6 decimal digits (approximately 20 bits of entropy).

If the nonce used to generate the authenticator output is based on a real-time clock, the nonce SHALL be changed at least once every 2 minutes. The OTP value associated with a given nonce SHALL be accepted only once.

#### 5.1.4.2. Single-factor OTP Verifiers

Single-factor OTP verifiers effectively duplicate the process of generating the OTP used by the authenticator. As such, the symmetric keys used by authenticators are also present in the verifier, and SHALL be strongly protected against compromise.

When a multi-factor OTP authenticator is being associated with a subscriber account, the verifier (or associated CSP) SHALL obtain secrets required to duplicate the authenticator output from the authenticator source (typically its manufacturer) using approved cryptography.

The verifier SHALL use approved encryption and an authenticated protected channel when collecting the OTP in order to provide resistance to eavesdropping and MitM attacks. Time-based OTPs SHALL have a lifetime of less than 2 minutes. In order to provide replay resistance as described in Section [5.2.7](#replay), verifiers SHALL accept a given time-based OTP only once during the validity period.

If the authenticator output has less than 64 bits of entropy, the verifier SHALL implement a throttling mechanism that effectively limits the number of failed authentication attempts an attacker can make on the subscriber's account as described in [Section 5.2.2](#throttle).

The OTP is displayed on the device and manually input to the verifier. For example, an OTP device may display 6 characters at a time, thereby proving possession and control of the device. The multi-factor OTP device is <i>something you have</i>, and it SHALL be activated by either <i>something you know</i> or <i>something you are</i>.</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  </div>


#### 5.1.5.1. Multi-factor OTP Authenticators

Multi-factor OTP authenticators operate in a similar manner to single-factor OTP authenticators (see [Section 5.1.4.1](#sfotpa)), except that they require the entry of either a memorized secret or use of a biometric to obtain a password from the authenticator. Each use of the authenticator SHALL require the input of the additional factor.

The authenticator output SHALL have at least 6 decimal digits of entropy. The output SHALL be generated by using an approved block cipher or hash function to combine a symmetric key stored on a personal hardware device with a nonce to generate an OTP. The nonce MAY be based on the date and time or on a counter generated on the device.

Any memorized secret used by the authenticator for activation SHALL be at least 6 decimal digits in length or of equivalent complexity and SHALL be rate limited as specified in [Section 5.2.2](#throttle). A biometric activation factor SHALL meet the requirements of [Section 5.2.3](#biometric_use), including limits on the number of consecutive authentication failures.

The unencrypted key and activation secret or biometric sample (and any biometric data derived from the biometric sample such as a probe produced through signal processing) SHALL be erased from memory immediately after a password has been generated.

#### 5.1.5.2. Multi-factor OTP Verifiers

Multi-factor OTP verifiers effectively duplicate the process of generating the OTP used by the authenticator, but without the requirement that a second factor be provided. As such, the symmetric keys used by authenticators SHALL be strongly protected against compromise.

When a multi-factor OTP authenticator is being associated with a subscriber account, the verifier (or associated CSP) SHALL obtain secrets required to duplicate the authenticator output from the authenticator source (typically its manufacturer) using approved cryptography. The verifier or CSP SHALL also establish, via the authenticator source, that the authenticator is a multi-factor device. In the absence of a trusted statement that it is a multi-factor device, the verifier SHALL treat it the authenticator as single-factor, in accordance with [Section 5.1.4](#singlefactorOTP).

The verifier SHALL use approved encryption and SHALL utilize an authenticated protected channel when collecting the OTP in order to provide resistance to eavesdropping and MitM attacks. Time-based OTPs SHALL have a lifetime of less than 2 minutes.  In order to provide replay resistance as described in [Section 5.2.7](#verifier-secrets), verifiers SHALL accept a given time-based OTP only once during the validity period.

If the authenticator output or activation secret has less than 64 bits of entropy, the verifier SHALL implement a throttling mechanism that effectively limits the number of failed authentication attempts an attacker can make on the subscriber's account as described in [Section 5.2.2](#throttle). A biometric activation factor SHALL meet the requirements of [Section 5.2.3](#biometric_use), including limits on the number of consecutive authentication failures.

#### 5.1.6.1. Single-factor Cryptographic Software Authenticators

Single-factor software cryptographic authenticators encapsulate a secret key that is unique to the authenticator. The key SHALL be stored in the most secure storage available on the device (e.g., keychain storage, trusted platform module, or trusted execution environment if available). The key SHALL be strongly protected against unauthorized disclosure by the use of access controls that limit access to the key to only those software components on the device requiring access.

#### 5.1.6.2. Single-factor Cryptographic Software Verifiers

#### 5.1.7.1. Single-factor Cryptographic Device Authenticators

Single-factor cryptographic device authenticators encapsulate a secret key that is unique to the device and SHALL NOT be exportable (i.e., it cannot be removed from the device). The authenticator operates by signing a challenge nonce presented through a direct computer interface such as a USB port. Although cryptographic devices contain software, they differ from cryptographic software authenticators by the fact that all embedded software is under control of the CSP (or other issuer), and that the entire authenticator is subject to any applicable FIPS 140 requirements at the AAL being authenticated.

The secret key and its algorithm SHALL provide at least the minimum security length specified in the latest revision of [[SP 800-131A]](#SP800-131A) (112 bits as of the date of this publication). The challenge nonce SHALL be at least 64 bits in length. Approved cryptography SHALL be used.

Single-factor cryptographic device authenticators SHOULD require a physical input such as the pressing of a button in order to operate. This provides defense against unintended operation of the device, which might occur if the device to which it is connected is compromised.

#### 5.1.7.2. <a name="sfcdv"></a>Single-factor Cryptographic Device Verifiers

Single-factor cryptographic device verifiers generate a challenge nonce, send it to the corresponding authenticator, and use the authenticator output to verify possession of the device. The authenticator output is highly dependent on the specific cryptographic device and protocol, but it is generally some type of signed message.

The verifier has either symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic keys corresponding to each authenticator. While both types of keys SHALL be protected against modification, symmetric keys SHALL additionally be strongly protected against unauthorized disclosure.

The challenge nonce SHALL be at least 64 bits in length, and SHALL either be unique over the lifetime of the authenticator or statistically unique (generated using an approved random bit generator).

The verifier has either symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic keys corresponding to each authenticator. While both types of keys SHALL be protected against modification, symmetric keys SHALL additionally be strongly protected against unauthorized disclosure.

The challenge nonce SHALL be at least 64 bits in length, and SHALL either be unique over the lifetime of the authenticator or statistically unique (generated using an approved random bit generator). The verification operation SHALL use approved cryptography.

#### 5.2. General Authenticator Requirements

#### 5.2.1. Physical Authenticators

CSPs SHALL provide subscriber instructions on how to appropriately  protect the authenticator against theft or loss. The CSP SHALL provide a mechanism to revoke or suspend the authenticator immediately upon notification from subscriber that loss or theft of the authenticator is suspected.

#### <a name="throttle"></a>5.2.2. Rate Limiting (Throttling)

When required in the authenticator type descriptions under [Section 5.1](#reqauthtype), the verifier SHALL implement controls to protect against online guessing attacks. Unless otherwise specified in the description of a given authenticator, the verifier SHALL effectively limit online attackers to no more than 100 consecutive failed attempts on a single account.

Additional techniques MAY be used to prioritize authentication attempts that are likely to come from the subscriber over those that are more likely to come from an attacker:

- Requiring the claimant to complete a CAPTCHA before attempting authentication.

- Requiring the claimant to wait following a failed attempt for a period of time that is increasing in intervals from, say, 30 seconds to an hour, as the account approaches its maximum allowance for consecutive failed attempts.

- Only accepting authentication requests from a white list of IP addresses at which the subscriber has been successfully authenticated before.

- Leveraging other risk-based or adaptive authentication techniques to identify user behavior that falls within, or out of, typical norms.

When the subscriber successfully authenticates, the verifier SHOULD disregard any previous failed attempts from the same IP address.

#### <a name="biometric_use"></a>5.2.3. Use of Biometrics

For a variety of reasons, this document supports only limited use of biometrics for authentication. These include:

- Biometric False Match Rates (FMR) and False Non-Match Rates (FNMR) do not provide confidence in the authentication of the subscriber by themselves. In addition, FMR and FNMR do not account for spoofing attacks.
- Biometric matching is probabilistic, whereas the other authentication factors are deterministic.
- Biometric template protection schemes provide a method for revoking biometric credentials that are comparable to other authentication factors (e.g., PKI certificates and passwords). However, the availability of such solutions is limited, and standards for testing these methods are under development.
- Biometric characteristics do not constitute secrets.  They can be obtained online or by taking a picture of someone with a camera phone (e.g., facial images) with or without their knowledge, lifted from through objects someone touches (e.g., latent fingerprints), or captured with high resolution images (e.g., iris patterns). While presentation attack detection (PAD) technologies such as liveness detection can mitigate the risk of these types of attacks, additional trust in the sensor is required to ensure that PAD is operating properly in accordance with the needs of the CSP and the subscriber.

Therefore, the use of biometrics for authentication is supported with the following requirements and guidelines:

Biometrics SHALL be used only as part of a multi-factor authentication with a physical authenticator (something you have).

An authenticated protected channel between sensor (or endpoint containing a sensor that resists sensor replacement) and verifier SHALL be established and the sensor or endpoint authenticated **prior** to capturing the biometric sample from the claimant.

Empirical testing of the biometric system to be deployed SHALL demonstrate an EER of **1 in 1000** or better with respect to matching performance. The biometric system SHALL operate with an FMR of **1 in 1000** or better.

The biometric system SHOULD implement PAD. Testing of the biometric system to be deployed SHOULD demonstrate at least 90% resistance to presentation attacks for each relevant attack type (aka species), where resistance is defined as the number of thwarted presentation attacks divided by the number of trial presentation attacks.

>Note: PAD is being considered as a mandatory requirement in future editions of this guideline.

The biometric system SHALL allow no more than 5 consecutive failed authentication attempts or 10 consecutive failed attempts if PAD meeting the above requirements is implemented. Once that limit has been reached, the biometric authenticator SHALL either:

- Impose a delay of at least 30 seconds before the next attempt, increasing exponentially with each successive attempt, e.g., 1 minute before the following failed attempt, 2 minutes before the second following attempt, etc. 

**OR**

- Disable the biometric user verification and offer another factor (a different biometric modality or a PIN/Passcode if it is not already a required factor) if such an alternative method is already implemented. 

Determination of sensor/endpoint performance, integrity, and authenticity can be accomplished in several different ways, any of which are acceptable under this guideline.  These include but are not limited to: authentication of the sensor or endpoint, certification by an approved accreditation authority, or runtime interrogation of signed metadata (e.g., attestation) as described in [Section 5.2.4](#attestation).

Biometric matching SHOULD be performed locally on claimant's device or MAY be performed at a central verifier.

If matching is performed centrally:

* Use of the biometric SHALL be limited to one or more specific devices that are identified using approved cryptography.
* Biometric revocation, referred to as biometric template protection in [ISO/IEC 24745](#ISO24745), SHALL be implemented.
* All transmission of biometrics shall be over the authenticated protected channel.

Biometric samples collected in the authentication process MAY be used to train matching algorithms or, with user consent, for other research purposes. Biometric samples (and any biometric data derived from the biometric sample such as a probe produced through signal processing) SHALL be erased from memory immediately after any training or research data has been derived.

Biometrics are also used in some cases to prevent repudiation of registration and to verify that the same individual participates in all phases of the registration process as described in SP 800-63A.

#### <a name="attestation"></a>5.2.4. Attestation

Attestation is information conveyed to the verifier regarding a directly connected authenticator or the endpoint involved in an authentication operation. Information conveyed by attestation MAY include, but is not limited to:

* The provenance (manufacturer or supplier certification), health, and integrity of the authenticator and/or endpoint.
* Security features of the authenticator.
* Security and performance characteristics of biometric sensor(s).
* Sensor modality.

If this attestation is signed, it SHALL be signed using a digital signature that provides at least the minimum security strength specified in the latest revision of [[SP 800-131A]](#SP800-131A) (112 bits as of the date of this publication).

Attestation information MAY be used as part of a risk-based authentication decision.

#### <a name="verifimpers"></a>5.2.5. Verifier Impersonation Resistance

Verifier impersonation attacks, sometimes referred to as "phishing attacks", refer to attempts by fraudulent verifiers and RPs to fool an unwary claimant into authenticating to an impostor website. In previous editions of SP 800-63, protocols that are resistant to verifier impersonation attacks were also referred to as "strongly MitM resistant".

Authentication protocols that are verifier impersonation resistant SHALL authenticate the verifier and either:

1. Strongly and irreversibly bind the authenticator output to the public key of the certificate presented by the verifier to which it is sent, or to that verifier's authenticated hostname or domain name; or

2. Determine whether the verifier's authenticated hostname or domain name is on a list of trusted verifiers, and release the authenticator output only to a verifier on that list.

One example of the former class of verifier impersonation resistant authentication protocols is client-authenticated TLS, because the client signs the authenticator output along with earlier messages from the protocol that are unique to the particular TLS connection being negotiated. Other protocols that MAY be used are techniques that irreversibly include the verifier's hostname or domain in the generation of the authenticator output, making that authenticator output unusable by a fraudulent verifier (the attacker) if proxied to the intended verifier.

The latter class of verifier impersonation resistant protocols relies on access control to release the authenticator output only to trusted verifiers.

In contrast, authenticators that involve the manual entry of an authenticator output, such as out of band and OTP authenticators, SHALL NOT be considered verifier impersonation resistant because they assume the vigilance of the claimant to determine that they are communicating with the intended verifier.

#### <a name="csp-verifier"></a>5.2.6. Verifier-CSP Communications

In situations where the verifier and CSP are separate entities (as shown by the dotted line in [[SP 800-63-3 Figure 4-1]](sp800-63-3.html#63Sec4-Figure1)), communications between the verifier and CSP SHALL occur through a mutually-authenticated secure channel (such as a client-authenticated TLS connection) using approved cryptography.

#### <a name="verifier-secrets"></a>5.2.7. Verifier Compromise Resistance

Use of some types of authenticators requires that the verifier store a copy of the authenticator secret. For example, an OTP authenticator (described in [Section 5.1.4](#singlefactorOTP)) requires that the verifier independently generate the authenticator output for comparison against the value sent by the claimant. Because of the potential for the verifier to be compromised and stored secrets stolen, authentication protocols that do not require the verifier to persistently store secrets that could be used for authentication are considered stronger, and are described herein as being *verifier compromise resistant*. Note that such verifiers are not resistant to all attacks; a verifier could be compromised in a different way, such as to always accept a particular  authenticator output.

Verifier compromise resistance can be achieved in different ways, for example:

1. Use a cryptographic authenticator that requires that the verifier store a public key corresponding to a private key held by the authenticator.

2. Store the expected authenticator output in hashed form. This method can be used with some look-up secret authenticators (described in [Section 5.1.2](#lookupsecrets)), for example.

In order to be considered verifier compromise resistant, public keys stored by the verifier SHALL use approved cryptography and SHALL provide at least the minimum security strength specified in the latest revision of [[SP 800-131A]](#SP800-131A) (112 bits as of the date of this publication).

Other verifier compromise resistant secrets SHALL use approved hash algorithms and the underlying secrets SHALL have at least the minimum security strength specified in the latest revision of [[SP 800-131A]](#SP800-131A) (112 bits as of the date of this publication). Note that secrets (such as memorized secrets) having lower complexity SHALL NOT be considered verifier compromise resistant when hashed because of the potential to defeat the hashing process through dictionary lookup or exhaustive search.

#### <a name="replay"></a>5.2.8. Replay Resistance

An authentication process resists replay attacks if it is impractical to achieve a successful authentication by recording and replaying a previous authentication message. Replay resistance is in addition to the replay resistant nature of authenticated protected channel protocols, since the output could be stolen prior to entry into the protected channel. Protocols that use nonces or challenges to prove the "freshness" of the transaction are resistant to replay attacks since the verifier will easily detect that the old protocol messages replayed do not contain the appropriate nonces or timeliness data related to the current authentication session.

Examples of replay resistant authenticators are OTP devices, cryptographic authenticators, and look-up secrets.

In contrast, memorized secrets are not considered replay resistant because the authenticator output (the secret itself) is provided for each authentication.

#### <a name="intent"></a>5.2.9. Authentication Intent

An authentication process requires intent if it requires the subject to explicitly respond to each authentication or reauthentication request. The goal of authentication intent is to make it more difficult for directly connected physical authenticators (cryptographic devices) to be used without the subject's knowledge, such as by malware on the endpoint. Authentication intent SHALL be established by the authenticator itself, although multi-factor cryptographic devices MAY establish intent by reentry of the other authentication factor on the endpoint with which the authenticator is used.

Authentication intent MAY be established in a number of ways. Authentication processes that require intervention of the subject, e.g., to enter an authenticator output on their endpoint from an OTP device, establish intent by their very nature.  Cryptographic devices that require user action (e.g., pushing a button or reinsertion) for each authentication or reauthentication operation are also considered to establish intent.
