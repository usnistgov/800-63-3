### Authority

This publication has been developed by NIST in accordance with its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, 44 U.S.C. § 3541 et seq., Public Law  (P.L.) 113-283. NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems without the express approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority over such systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130.

Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made mandatory and binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official. This publication may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright in the United States. Attribution would, however, be appreciated by NIST.

### Reports on Computer Systems Technology

The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public
welfare by providing technical leadership for the Nation’s measurement
and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test methods,
reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses
to advance the development and productive use of information technology.
ITL’s responsibilities include the development of management,
administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for the
cost-effective security and privacy of other than national
security-related information in Federal information systems. The Special
Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and
outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative
activities with industry, government, and academic organizations.

### Abstract

This document and its companion documents, SP 800-63-3, SP 800-63A, and SP 800-63C, provide technical and procedural guidelines to agencies implementing electronic authentication to choose and implement effective authentication processes based on risk. The recommendation covers remote authentication of users (such as employees, contractors, or private individuals) interacting with government IT systems over open networks. It defines technical requirements for each
of the three authenticator assurance levels. This publication supersedes corresponding sections of NIST SP 800-63-1 and SP 800-63-2.

### Keywords

authentication; credential service provider; digital authentication; digital credentials; electronic authentication; electronic credentials.

### Acknowledgements

The authors would like to acknowledge the thought leadership and innovation of the original authors: Donna F. Dodson, W. Timothy Polk, Sarbari Gupta, and Emad A. Nabbus.  Without their tireless efforts, we would not have had the incredible baseline from which to evolve 800-63 to the document it is today.

## Executive Summary

Digital authentication is the process of establishing confidence that a given claimant is the same as a subscriber that has previously authenticated. The robustness of this confidence is described by categorization known as the Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL). The separation of AAL from Identity Assurance Level (IAL), described in SP 800-63A, better supports applications requiring strong authentication that may be pseudonomymous. The separation of authenticator issuance from the establishment of credentials binding those authenticators to individuals provides additional flexibility in the enrollment and identity proofing process.

This guideline addresses how an individual, known as a claimant, can securely authenticate to a Credential Service Provider to establish the context for a remote digital interaction.

The three AALs reflect the options agencies will select based on their risk profile and the potential harm caused by an invalid or fraudulent user accessing their systems. The AALs are as follows:

**AAL 1**: AAL 1 requires single factor authentication, giving some assurance that the same claimant who participated in previous transactions is accessing the protected transaction or data.

**AAL 2**: AAL 2 requires two different authentication factors, providing higher assurance that the same claimaint who participated in previous transactions is accessing the protected transaction or data.

**AAL 3**: AAL 3 provides the highest practical remote digital authentication assurance. It requires proof of possession of a key in a physical multifactor authenticator through a cryptographic protocol.
